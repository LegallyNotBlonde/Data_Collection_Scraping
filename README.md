# Data_Collection_Scraping.
## This project provides insights into Mars' climate and weather conditions.

In this project, I apply my web scraping and data analysis skills to gather and analyze data from Mars-related sources. Using Splinter for automated browsing and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, I extract valuable information and transform it into meaningful insights. This project reinforces my ability to collect, organize, store, and analyze data, as well as visually communicate findings.

* The first part focuses on scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles. I use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site, inspect page elements, and extract text elements with Beautiful Soup. The data is stored in Python dictionaries and lists, and exported to a JSON file for ease of sharing.

* The second part involves scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from an HTML table. I visit the Mars Temperature Data Site, scrape the table data with Beautiful Soup, and assemble it into a Pandas DataFrame. After ensuring data types are correct, I analyze the dataset to answer questions about Martian weather patterns, such as identifying the coldest and warmest months and variations in atmospheric pressure. The results are visualized through bar charts, and the DataFrame is exported to a CSV file.
